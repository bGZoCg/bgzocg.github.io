      <description>In general. I have finished the test of probability theory today. I still have a lot of regrets about the education I received, because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything.

      <description>Introduction to Software Engineering talked about the main steps of Agile Development-Agile Development that I learned on TG a few months ago in the course, which I came into contact with in my spare time. Fragmented knowledge turned out to be embedded in such theories. I was sitting in the last row and looking forward. Although there were no seats, basically no one listened to this part of the content, let alone internalized thoughts.</description>

      <description>Then I used following:
  Brand Type Feeling   Apple EarPods  The headphones are very conscience, the sound is very positive, the only shortcoming is that the line is easy to yellow   Edifier H295P  Remember not much, similar to Apple, there are more featured features.   Philips SHP9500 ......   Vido MX500 To put it bluntly, it is the sound of hammering iron, but the three paragraphs have whatever they want.</description>

The reason why I wrote this article is that after Wikipedia was blocked, I deeply feel the domestic the threshold of access to knowledgeThe easy and flexible access to first-hand knowledge is high-CNKI, the libraries of various universities are not open to the outside world, and there are so few public resources.</description>
